## The Effect Of GDP On A Countrys CO2 Emission
Econometric Analysis-I Course Project

We constructed a better regression model with multiple regression, this report used
renewable energy consumption, access to electricity, percentage of manufacturing factor
in GDP, and urban population as explanatory variables. The consumption of renewable
energy was chosen for the simple reason that if more renewable energy is consumed,
there is a greater chance that a country will use less energy that releases CO2. As
previously said, low-income countries may have difficulty getting renewable energy
sources, which can lead to a variety of outcomes. In terms of access to power, it is
possible that countries with limited access to electricity will experience a lack of energy,
resulting in low CO2 emissions. With regard to the proportion of manufacturing factor, it
is reasonable to assume that a country with a high percentage of manufacturing factor
will have a greater number of factories, resulting in an increase in CO2 emissions.The
number of urban residents was chosen since cities typically consume more energy than
rural areas. When a result, it is believed that as the population of a city grows, more
energy would be consumed, resulting in increased CO2 emissions.A dummy variable is
added to the developed and developing countries, depending on whether the country is an
OECD member or not. The five important partner countries are also included in the
OECD dummy variable.

The key log gdp variable remained positive coefficients throughout the results from the
various regression models, confirming the basic premise that there will be a positive
correlation between the country's CO2 emission and increase in GDP per capita. Even
though it appears that several concerns from the robustness test may jeopardize the CLM
assumptions, which are crucial, the model did explain a high level of explanation, with
R-squared values approaching 0.94.
